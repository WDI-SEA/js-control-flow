// translator.js
// Write a program that reads a variable with language 
// code and prints the translation of "Hello World" for that language.

// Requirements

// You should have a variable for the language code (e.g. "es", "de", "fr", "en").
// Your program should print the translation of "Hello World" 
// based on the language code in the variable.
// It should support at least 3 languages
// Make sure to test with the different languages you choose.
// (Feel free to Google the translation if you aren't fluent.)
