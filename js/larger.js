// Write a program that reads two Number variables and prints which one is greater. (e.g. "The larger number of 7 and 3 is 7")

// Requirements

// Your program should maintain two variables
// It should correctly identify which is larger and print that result



x = 32
y = 17

if (x > y)  {
    larger = x
}   else {
    larger = y
}

console.log("The larger number of " + x + " and " + y + " is " + larger)
