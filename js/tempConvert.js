// Write a program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to another temperature unit indicated by a variable.

// Requirements

// Your program should store an integer (in Fahrenheit) in a variable.
// You should also have a variable holding either "k" or "c" indicating a conversion to Kelvin or Celsius, respectively.
// Convert from F to C or K based on the indicator variable.
// The output of the program should read: "X degrees Fahrenheit is Y degrees Celsius/Kelvin"

const Fahrenheit = 90
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)

console.log(Fahrenheit + " degrees Fahrenheit " + "is " + Celsius + " degrees Celsius")
