# JS Control Flow!!!!!!!!!

### MORE CHANGES

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository
* Write JavaScript code to obtain the data prompted by each question
* The code for each exercise should be placed in separate `.js` files (see the `js` folder). This will make it easier to keep track of solutions
  * It may also be beneficial to copy/paste any data structures provided
* Run each file by typing `node js/nameOfFile.js`

---

### reverse.js
Write a program that will take a hardcoded string, and console log the reversed version of it.

**Requirements**
* You must use a `for` loop. No `.reverse()`
* You may use the string below

```js
var inputString = 'building';
```

---

### filterLongWords.js
Write a program that will take an array of words. Using a variable called `maxLength`, push words that are less than the `maxLength` into a new array, and `console.log` the value of `maxLength`.

**Requirements**
* Your array of words should be stored in a variable, which can be named whatever you like
* `maxLength` should be a positive number

---

### grade.js
Write a program that will print the letter grade, given a variable with a test score. Display either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F", for an score that is an integer between 0 and 100.

**Requirements**
* Your program should have a variable to store the letter grade (an integer between 0 and 100)
* For the letter grades, you may use whatever grading scale you like
* You must use a switch statement (hint, you may need to review and think about how the `switch` statement works)

### fizzbuzz.js
Implement Fizz Buzz. Loop from 1 to 100. If the number is divible by both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz". Otherwise, if the number if divisible by 3, print "fizz", or, if the number is divisible by 5, print "buzz". If none of the above are true, print the number. This is a very common interview question!

### phonebook.js
Use a for...in loop to examine the phoneBook Object below and print out the names of all the people who share the phone number "333-333-3333".
```
var phoneBook = {
