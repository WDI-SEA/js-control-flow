### grade.js
Write a program that will print the letter grade, given a variable with a test score. Display either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F", for an score that is an integer between 0 and 100.

**Requirements**
* Your program should have a variable to store the letter grade (an integer between 0 and 100)
* For the letter grades, you may use whatever grading scale you like
* You must use a switch statement (hint, you may need to review and think about how the `switch` statement works)

---

### pluralizer.js
Write a program that starts like...

```js
var thing = 'cat';
var count = 5;
```
and output the pluralized form of the word, depending on what `count` is. For example, "5 cats" or "1 dog". Change `thing` to different values to test your code!

**Requirements**
* Your program should pluralize the word based on an integer (`count`)

---

### tempConvert.js
Write a program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

**Requirements**
* Your program should take an integer (in Fahrenheit) and convert the temperature to Celsius.
* The output of the program should read: "X degrees Fahrenheit is Y degrees Celsius"

## Bonus

Rewrite your first answer in `grade.js` using a switch statement!
